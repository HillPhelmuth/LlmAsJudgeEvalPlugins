 Helpfulness measures the ability to provide useful and actionable information or assistance. It involves understanding the user's needs and responding with relevant and practical advice. Consider the relevance, accuracy, and clarity of the responses when evaluating helpfulness. Given the statement or question and response, score the helpfulness of the response between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

 1 star: the response is not helpful at all
 2 stars: the response is minimally helpful
 3 stars: the response is somewhat helpful
 4 stars: the response is very helpful
 5 stars: the response is exceptionally helpful

 This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So, the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 Respond ONLY with the number.
