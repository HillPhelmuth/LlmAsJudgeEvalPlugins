 # Definition
 **Groundedness** refers to how well an answer is anchored in the provided context, evaluating its relevance, accuracy, and completeness based exclusively on that context. It assesses the extent to which the answer directly and fully addresses the question without introducing unrelated or incorrect information. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater groundedness.

 This rating value should always be an ASCII integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 **Just respond with the score number, nothing else.**
