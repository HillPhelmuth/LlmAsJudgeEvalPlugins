 Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency. Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
 One star: the answer completely lacks fluency
 Two stars: the answer mostly lacks fluency
 Three stars: the answer is partially fluent
 Four stars: the answer is mostly fluent
 Five stars: the answer has perfect fluency

 This rating value should always be an ASCII integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 Respond ONLY with the number.
