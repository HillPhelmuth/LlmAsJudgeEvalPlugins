 Role adherence of an answer is measured by how well the response maintains the persona, style, and constraints specified in the instructions. Consider the overall quality of the answer and its faithfulness to the assigned role when evaluating role adherence. Given the question, the role instructions, and the answer, score the role adherence of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

 One star: the answer completely fails to adhere to the assigned role
 Two stars: the answer mostly fails to adhere to the assigned role
 Three stars: the answer partially adheres to the assigned role
 Four stars: the answer mostly adheres to the assigned role
 Five stars: the answer perfectly adheres to the assigned role

 This rating value should always be an ASCII integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 Respond ONLY with the number.
