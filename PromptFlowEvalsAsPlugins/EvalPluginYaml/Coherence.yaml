    Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
    One star: the answer completely lacks coherence
    Two stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence
    Three stars: the answer is partially coherent
    Four stars: the answer is mostly coherent
    Five stars: the answer has perfect coherency

    This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
    Respond ONLY with the number.
